<h2>Exercise 9</h2>

<h3>Subject</h3> 
Unit test with testing library  

<h3>Section 13</h3>
Frontend unit testing with dom testing library


<h3>Your tasks</h3>
Use the testing library for a few unit tests of grade calculator vanilla UI
<ul>
<li>"Grade Calculator" text exists on the DOM</li>
<li>* Upload file data/grades.csv via input -> 67.33 appears in UI</li>
<li>* Upload bad data via input -> 'No data found in the CSV file' appears in UI</li>
<li>* Upload file via input -> Calculate time is correct</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
<li>Invoke npm run dev to see the vanilla UI - i have added label and error element</li>
<li>Create the file main-ui.test.ts under  exercises\9\final\test</li>
<li>Look for the dom testing library in the dictionary file under docs</li>
<li>The tasks with Upload files are marked as difficult, but look at my solution if you have a problem loading the file and continue with the unit test</li>
</ol>
